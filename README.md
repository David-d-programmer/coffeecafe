Welcome to Coffee Cafe!

This projects is built so that user can input the sales value and the cost value for 7 coffees brand for each day. 
This will automatically calculate the profit, so the user will know if he or she has been making profit or loss and if the loss is more than the profit for a particular coffee brand.
Then the sales of the coffee brand that is not bringing in profit will be stopped.
The user is also given five options to navigate through e.g getting sales values for previous sales which might be used to forcast on the future running of the coffee cafe.


## Reminders

- The code has beeen properly placed in the `run.py` file and all documentation has been done to give clearity and understanding to anyone reading the code.
- dependencies has also been placed in the `requirements.txt` file and pushed to the git hub.
- All downloaded files are not tampered with to ensure a successful deployment of the project, which has been tested to run properly and accurately without any error in loading.

## Creating the Heroku app

After creating the app in heroku, the first thing to look at was the settings where the config var was revealed and our `CREDS` file was added to the key successful, also build packs were added in the order seen below:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

And this was connected to my GitHub

## Constraints

Since the deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows and what i had was more than that, some lines were wrapped to the next line. This is the contraint i experienced.

The link to my definition of selling price - cost price was gotten from the link below:

Every thing done in the code was from the videos i watched from the lessons and also my mentor was very handy by putting me through every step of the day way.
