Welcome to Coffee Cafe!

This is a Cafe shop that helps owner determine his profit and loss which helps to forecast on the future of the business. The projects works in such a way that it helps the cafe owner to  input the sales value and the cost value for 7 coffees brand for each day of transaction. 

This app automatically calculates the profit and loss, so the user will know if he or she has been making profit or loss, and if the loss is more than the profit for a particular coffee brand the owner of the cafe will able to make wise decision decision in favour of the cafe.

The cafe owner can decide to streamline his available product for sale to just 5, where the user can pick from so as to enable getting sales values for previous sales which might be used to forecast on the future running of the coffee cafe.

This project was inspired after concluding on my rock, paper and scissors project, so I discovered that if itâ€™s in the real world; guessing is not the best choice.
